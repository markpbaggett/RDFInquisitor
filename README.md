RDF Inquisitor
==============

![Test Doctests](https://github.com/markpbaggett/RDFInquisitor/workflows/Test%20Doctests/badge.svg)

RDF Inquisitor is designed to allow you to question the RDF your URIs point at.  It assumes these URIs adhere to the 
best practices described in [Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies](https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/) 
and [Cool URIs for the Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/).
